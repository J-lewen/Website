My research interests span psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience, ERPology and social cognition. Broadly, my work falls into four main themes:

#### ERPology

Over the last 60 years, ERP methodolgy has developed so as to be unrecognisable from the original research of the 70's and 80's. With these methodological developments come significant changes in our understanding of best practice. Substantial efforts have been made to encourage best-practice data acquisition, pre-processing and analyses:




Despite this, there remain considerable inconsistencies that undermine our ability to consolidate findings on any given topic.

#### ERP Indices of Speech Processing

#### Bilingualism

#### Social Cognition

###### - One-stage vs Two-stage Processing

###### - Neuroscientific Methods in Social Cognition
