My research interests span psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience, ERPology and social cognition. Broadly, my work falls into four main themes:

#### ERPology

Over the last 60 years, ERP methodolgy has developed so as to be unrecognisable from the original research of the 70's and 80's. With these methodological developments come significant changes in our understanding of best practice. Substantial efforts have been made to encourage best-practice data acquisition, pre-processing and analyses:




Despite this, there remain considerable inconsistencies that undermine our ability to consolidate findings on any given topic.

#### ERP Indices of Speech Processing

My projects pertaining to the ERP indices of speech processing predominantly seek better our understanding of certain ERP brainwaves and their proposed functional/neurobiological accounts. My 
current work within this theme explores distinctions drawn between brainwaves associated with phonological and semantic processing, and to explore the extent to which these ERP indices are  language-specific, or common to other structured domains such as music. One overarching aim of this work is to develop a reliable electrophysiological timeline of speech processing equivalent to that for visual language processing, thus enabling future research to better explore and identify the mechanisms underpinning auditory language processing. 

#### Bilingualism

#### Social Cognition

My second research area involves applying my findings regarding auditory language prediction to better understand how the brain responds to manipulation of linguistic/non-linguistic social information. At present I am particularly interested in exploring how a listener forms stereotypes/assumptions about a speaker based on voice (e.g., conclusions as to socioeconomic status, race, sexuality, gender), and how the processing of pragmatic information
overlaps temporally with linguistic information mapping. The use of ERPs to explore attitudes/stereotypes is a largely unexplored field, and offers immense potential for investigations into 
explicit/implicit attitudes, as well as a baselines upon which to explore neuroatypical integration of 
speaker social information (i.e., in ASD populations).

###### - One-stage vs Two-stage Processing

###### - Neuroscientific Methods in Social Cognition

I have a sustained interest in bi/multi-lingualism, language co-activation and language-experience evoked neuroplasticity. I am particularly interested in research into understudied languages, and working to reduce the euro-centric bias continually present in linguistic research.
