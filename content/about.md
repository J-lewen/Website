I am an academic currently working at [New York University Abu Dhabi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/) (NYUAD). My research interests fall within the fields of psycholinguistics, cognitive neuroscience, ERPology, and social cognition. 

Specifically, my current work follow three main themes: (i) the development of functional 
and neurobiological accounts of speech processing, alongside improvements in replicability & standardisation of reporting in ERP research (ii) investigations into listener extraction of non-linguistic, pragmatic information (e.g., attitudes/stereotypes, and inferences about gender/sexuality/age/race), and (iii) eye-tracking and ERP investigations into the cognitive mechanisms underpinning bi/multilingualism. I teach courses spanning statistics & research methods, psycholinguistics, language impairments, critical appraisal & evidence-based practice, and neurobiology/cognitive neuroscience.

In my spare time, I enjoy [writing articles about academia](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03566-4), creating ERP databases & resources, cooking, jumping in lakes, good beer, growing plants, and taking photos of the great outdoors so that I can remember what it looks like despite the sedentary nature of my job.
