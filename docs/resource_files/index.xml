      <description>Here is some hopefully useful stuff, including ERP analysis and pre-processing resources (i.e., scripts and video tutorials on pre-processing and data analysis using a variety of software), unpublished research output (i.e., databases, useful papers), and teaching material.
Everything is released under a CC-BY license, which means you can do anything you want with these materials and can change/adapt them in any way you like, as long as you acknowledge that you got it from here.</description>
